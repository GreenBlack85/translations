# Watchfaces Translations

This directory contains translation files for the Watchface settings. I currently support multiple languages and am continuously working to improve the quality and accuracy of the translations.

## Current Translation Status

I have translation files for various languages, but I need your help to ensure they are accurate, natural, and culturally appropriate. Native speakers and bilingual users are especially valuable in this process.

## How You Can Help

I'm looking for volunteers to review existing translations and help me identify:

- **Accuracy issues**: Incorrect translations or mistranslations
- **Grammar and syntax errors**: Language-specific grammatical mistakes
- **Cultural appropriateness**: Terms that may not be suitable for specific regions
- **Consistency**: Ensuring terminology is used consistently throughout
- **Missing translations**: Untranslated strings 
- **Technical terminology**: Proper translation of watch and UI-related terms


## How to Report Issues

If you find translation issues or have suggestions for improvements:

1. Note the specific language file and string that needs attention
2. Provide the current translation and your suggested improvement
3. Either comment on the file, create a pull request, or send me an email with what needs to be changed
