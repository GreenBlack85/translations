Data Rich watchface inspired by Fenix 8 Iron Grid 

Note that this watchface is made by a third party and is not an official Garmin Fenix8 watchface. It does not represent the functionality or performance of the original watchface.

⭐️ Free vs Pro ⭐️
This watchface is available at no cost with all basic functions. Premium features (marked with [*]) require a Pro Key to unlock. You can purchase a Pro Key here: https://ko-fi.com/s/bca3846ae1 or https://watchface.io/fenix8v3, or purchase the PRO version here: https://apps.garmin.com/apps/844f8455-c828-489d-b94a-a72416ee7df6.

⭐️ MIPS Devices (Fenix 7, Enduro, Forerunner 255, etc) ⭐️
This watchface is fully optimized for MIPS, but colors can look different as in most pictures, as these are taken on an Amoled device. This watchface has many themes optimized for MIPS and supports MIPS gradients. You can find all the build in themes here: https://watchface.io/fenix8v3/themes#MIPS
